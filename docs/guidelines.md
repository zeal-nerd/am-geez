## ✨Key bindings✨

The am-geez input method supports multiple combinations of prefix and suffix characters, allowing users to type characters in a way that relates closely to their phonetic sounds.


The keybindings are as follows:
<div>
  <img style="width: 46%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6477fd95-09f1-4b3d-8ed8-b71037a05602">
  <img style="width: 46%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abc9c4f-bf6a-4e62-8e9e-79281f0b2392">
</div>

You can find the pdf 📄 [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17029134/kbd.pdf).
### ⌨️ Guidelines

  - _ (underscore) means there is no input or no letter.
  - Prefix characters can sometimes be the same character repeated multiple times.
  - Suffix characters can only be one or two characters in length and are designed to correspond to the sound of the characters. A suffix should never repeat the same characters.
  - There may be more than one way to type a character. Use the method that works best for you.
  - By default, this input method uses the Amharic number system, as shown on the second page.
#### 🔢 Amharic Number System:
  This input method supports the default Amharic numbering system, with the corresponding key as showen in the above image.

## 📚Examples
Below you have an example poem written in both the Amharic script and the keybinding version.
  ```text
  **Amharic version**
የመጣንበትን ተልኮም ባናዉቀዉ
መልካሙን እንሥራ ትርጉም እንዲኖረው

      ለመኖር ትርጉሙ ስሜት የሚሰጠው
      ለምንኖርበት ምክኒያት ሲኖረን ነው።

  **Key binding version**
yemeTanbetn telkom banawuqequ
melkamun ensra trgum endinorew

      lemenor trgumu smiet yemiseTew
      lemnnorbet mkniyat sinoren new

  ```

**For the numbers, just type the number like this:**  
    `1` to type `፩`  
    `2` to type `፪`  
    `10` to type `፲`  
    `20` to type `፳`  
    `50` to type `፶`  
    `100` to type `፻` ...etc

**For typing Symbols:**  
    `.` to type `።`  
    `..` to type `.`  
    `,` to type `፣`  
    `;` to type `፤` ...etc
